# ERRBS-vs-RRBS
A comparison of ERRBS methylation data with RRBS methylation data

## Background 
__DNA methylation__ is an epigenetic mechanism in which methyl groups are added to the DNA molecule. Methylation can change the activity of a DNA segment without changing the sequence, playing a role in gene expression regulation. 
__Bisulfite sequencing__ (also known as bisulphite sequencing) is the use of bisulfite treatment of DNA to determine its pattern of methylation. In animals it predominantly involves the addition of a methyl group to the carbon-5 position of cytosine residues of the dinucleotide CpG. 
__Bisulfite sequencing__ applies routine sequencing methods on bisulfite-treated genomic DNA to determine methylation status at CpG dinucleotides. Treatment of DNA with bisulfite converts cytosine residues to uracil, but leaves 5-methylcytosine residues unaffected. Therefore DNA that has been treated with bisulfate retains only methylated cytosines thus yielding single-nucleotide resolution information about the methylation status of a segment of DNA.
