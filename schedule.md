# Schedule

## ERRBS and RRBS libraries
- What's the difference in the library preparation protocols?

## Methylcall data
- We use [Bismark](https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/bismark/) to align the sequencing reads (fastq) and genreate methylation calls
  - It would be useful to look at [Bismark paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/27/11/1571/216956) and their [RRBS guide](https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore/blob/master/Docs/RRBS_Guide.pdf)
